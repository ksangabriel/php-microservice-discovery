## About Service Discovery

Turreta Service Discovery is a Laravel-based web application that provides a registry of services where each client application register and lookup other services.

The registry of availale services are kept up-to-date by probing each registered service via callback URL. If a service does not response as expected, that service is marked as "down" and is ignored from the list of available services.
